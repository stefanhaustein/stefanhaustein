    <h1>DualUp Arcade</h1>

    <p>Most "retro" arcade kits seem to be designed to have a monitor 
        mounted "horizontally", while "real" arcades in the 80s typically 
        had the monitor mounted vertically.

    <p>For being able to play "modern" games, original arcade games and
        modern or console titles, the nearly square LG DualUp monitor
        seemed to be an ideal compromise.

    <p>As a starting point for this project, I ordered the 
        <a href="https://talentec.es/store/kits-bartop-en/configure-your-kit-bartop-24/?lang=en"></a>24" 
        tabletop arcarde kit from telentec. When the kit arrived, 
        it was immediately obvious that there was no way to fit the 
        DualUp in there (which is consistent with the maximum monitor height
        in the specs).

    <p>Fortunately, I had still two a x b cm plywood sheets lying around
        from a previous project.
