    <h1>DualUp Arcade</h1>

    <p>Most "retro" arcade kits seem to be designed to have a monitor 
        mounted "horizontally", while "real" arcades in the 80s typically 
        had the monitor mounted vertically.</p>

    <p>For being able to play "modern" games, original arcade games and
        retro console titles, the LG DualUp monitor, which has a nearly square form factor,
        seemed to be an ideal compromise.</p>

    <h2>Construction</h2>

    <p>As a starting point for this project, I ordered the 
        <a href="https://talentec.es/store/kits-bartop-en/configure-your-kit-bartop-24/?lang=en"></a>24" 
        tabletop arcarde kit from Talentec. When the kit arrived, 
        it was immediately obvious that there was no way to fit the 
        DualUp in there (which is consistent with the maximum monitor height
        in the Talentec specs).</p>

    <img src="img/1.jpg" width="100%">


    <p>Fortunately, I had still two 50x80cm plywood sheets lying around
        from a previous project. I used the original Talentec as a template 
        for drawing the outline of the top and bottom on my spare plywood
        sheets, then connected the top and bottom with a straight line.
        I also transferred the postions of the holes using a thin pencil.</p>
        
    <p>Following the wide turns with a jigsaw was relatively straightforward.</p>

    <img src="img/2.jpg" width="100%">

    <p>Ater a bit of sawing and drilling, I was able to connect my "custom" side
        parts with the remaining parts from the original Talentec kit.</p>


    <table>
        <tr>
            <td width="50%"><img src="img/4.jpg" width="100%"></td>
            <td width="50%"><img src="img/5.jpg" width="100%"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>The Talentec kit came with a MDF bar for holding the monitor using it's VESA mounting points.</td>
            <td>For comparison: The original Talentec side panel in front of my "custom" side panel.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
   
  
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td width="50%"><img src="img/6.jpg" width="100%"></td>
            <td width="50%"><img src="img/7.jpg" width="100%"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>This was enough to install the monitor and try the setup with an old mini PC, on which
        I installed Linux Mint for this project. Steam works, too! :)</p>
  
    <img src="img/9.jpg" width="100%">

    <p>I painted the sides gray...</p>

    <img src="img/11.jpg" width="100%">

    <p>...and the rest black.</p>

    <img src="img/10.jpg" width="100%">

    <p>To mount the Arcade, I am using a StarTech 19" rack that could be mounted to the wall. There is some unused piping
        at ground level where I intended to place the Arcade, and a rack seemed like a good place for the mini PC and
        accessories. 
    </p>

    <img src="img/12.jpg" width="100%">

    <p>For the buttons and joysticks, I ordered a cheap set from Amazon that included small boards converting the 
        controller signals to USB</p>

    <img src="img/13.jpg" width="100%">

    <p>The controls and boards were straightforward to mount to the removable controller panel that came with the arcade kit.</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td width="50%"><img src="img/14.jpg" width="100%"></td>
            <td width="50%"><img src="img/15.jpg" width="100%"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
 
    <p>Time for some Games! Now, only the loudspeakers, marquee and T-/U-molding are missing. The DualUp form factor is a perfect fit for GBC titles.</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td width="50%"><img src="img/16.jpg" width="100%"></td>
            <td width="50%"><img src="img/18.jpg" width="100%"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>T-molding, loudspeakers and amplifier installed -- only the marquee and U-molding are still missing.</td>
            <td>The finished product running a well-known arcade classic.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>


    <h2>Software Setup</h2>

    <p>Initially, I was planning to use a Raspberry Pi 4 with Batocera. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get reasonable frame rates,
        which I attributed to the (relatively) high resolution of the monitor.</p>

    <p>So instead of a "all in one" solution like Batocera, I installed Linux Mint and then installed Steam and EmulationStation on top
        and I am quite happy with this setup.
    </p>
