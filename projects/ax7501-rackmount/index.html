<h1>Rack-Mounting a Zyxel AX7501 Router</h1>

<p>While being one of the few routers approved for Swiss 10 gigabit
fiber networks, there doesn't seem to be an "official" 
rack mounting option for the Zyxel AX7501.

<p>My first idea was to 3d-print two "ears" that would hold the 
router in place, but the odd shape of the device made me give
up on this quickly.

<p>So I just "velcroed" it to a regular rack shelf and just used
3d-printed covers with keystone mounting ports to expose the ethernet
ports at the front panel.

<p>The stl file for the covers can be found at
